# Hear-Me
Hear Me is an offline open-source, non-profit offline AI project bridging communication between deaf and hearing people. It supports multiple languages, allowing users to create and share their own sign languages. With real-time sign to speech and speech to sign AI, we break barriers together, we hear each other.
